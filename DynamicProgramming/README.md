# Dynamic Programming
  
Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggests that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming.  
  
1) Overlapping Subproblems  
2) Optimal Substructure  
  
**Overlapping Subproblems**
  
 Dynamic Programming is mainly used when solutions of same subproblems are needed again and again. In dynamic programming, computed solutions to subproblems are stored in a table so that these donâ€™t have to be recomputed. So Dynamic Programming is not useful when there are no common (overlapping) subproblems because there is no point storing the solutions if they are not needed again.   
   
There are following two different ways to store the values so that these values can be reused:  
a) Memoization (Top Down)  
b) Tabulation (Bottom Up)  
  
**Optimal Substructure**
  
 A given problems has Optimal Substructure Property if optimal solution of the given problem can be obtained by using optimal solutions of its subproblems
