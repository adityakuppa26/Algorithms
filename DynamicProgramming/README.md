# Dynamic Programming
  
Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggests that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming.  
  
1) Overlapping Subproblems  
2) Optimal Substructure
